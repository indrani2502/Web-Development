Hello everyone;
I have uploaded a rar file called home.rar. Well the first basic step to start learning Web Development is getting familiar with HTML.
For learning HTML, i recommend learning from w3schools.com
Once you are familiar with the coding, the next step is to practise these  practically and develop a web page.
home.rar is a basic web page which has been created only using HTML. This is an amazing start for development of web pages.
